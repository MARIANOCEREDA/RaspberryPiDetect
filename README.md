# RaspberryPiDetect
This project presents the implementation of a machine vision application specifically designed to automate and improve the process of counting sticks in log bales. 
In addition, it explores how this tool can be used to optimize log inventory tracking and calculate an accurate estimate of the average diameter in groups of counted bundles.
